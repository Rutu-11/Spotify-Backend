# **Spotify-backend**

The repository created to deploy Spotify backend would contain all the necessary files and configurations required to host and run the backend of the Spotify application. It would likely include a combination of source code, documentation, and deployment scripts.

At a high level, the repository would include the code that powers the backend of the Spotify application, including APIs, database connections, and other necessary components. This code would be written in a programming language like Java, Python, or Node.js, and would be designed to run on a server or cloud infrastructure.
